# Complete Config File

This example config file (should) demonstrate every possible config option.

As long as our unit tests are passing, anything you see here should work. ðŸ˜…

Note that options shown here are **not necessarily the defaults**. For example, if you omit `slugify_columns`, it will be `false`, _not_ `true` as shown below.

```{eval-rst}
Ideally, these options are so amazingly intuitive that you can just copy-paste what you need and get going. But if not, don't worry. We'll cover everything in :doc:`options`.

.. literalinclude:: config_complete.yaml
    :language: yaml

Now let's look at :doc:`each option in detail <options>`.
