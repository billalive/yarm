  If you altered your original column names in `input:`_, e.g. with `slugify_columns:`_ or `lowercase_columns:`_, then you must **use those altered column names now**. If you try to use the original names, you'll get an error.

  Remember, the order for these blocks does not matter. Even if your `input:`_ block is at the end of your file, it will still be processed first.
